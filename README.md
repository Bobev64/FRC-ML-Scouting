This repo is an attempt at using object detection from VODs provided by [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/) to gain statistical insights beyond the conventional FIRST API. 

## Dataset
The dataset can be found [here](https://app.roboflow.com/robotdetect/robot-detect-ckwwl/). The current dataset focuses on FIM competitions in particular for consistency in camera conditions. Could use more diversity in the dataset for better robot detection.
